When identifying variables, and storing their names, 

I want either a var, a function, a class, or an input argument. 

Want to highlight the variable if found in the text. 

Provide basic autocompletion suggestion

Highlight function calls and classes differently than variable names

Initially store a vector of identifier as they appear. 

Store a list of identifiers and whether they are a function, a class, or a variable. 

This can be a tuple of Identifier string, and idType

tuple(string, idType);
